Traveling to Europe anytime soon? The Airbnb project might be just for you.

Welcome to another beginner friendly sql project which is a part of my sql series for beginners - just like me.
Who doesn‚Äôt love the feeling for planning our next vacation or quick get away trip.
‚úàÔ∏è step 1 : Choosing the destination and booking the flights.
üè† step 2 : Finding a wonderful place to stay at.
We will be looking for  a modern or charming place, central or in the rural era so we can enjoy the gift of nature.It really depends if your goal is to explore or to relax.
To find the place that suits our needs and to understand better the airbnb dataset ,we‚Äôll ask some questions that hopefully we‚Äôll be able to answer with sql!
